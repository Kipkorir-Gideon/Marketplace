# Infrastructure Setup and Deployment Documentation

This README file provides an overview of the infrastructure setup and deployment processes for the scalable e-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture.

## Overview

The infrastructure for this e-commerce platform is designed to support the deployment of multiple microservices, including:

- Product Catalog Service
- User Management Service
- Order Service
- Payment Service
- API Gateway
- Redis for caching

The services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes on AWS.

## Kubernetes Configuration

The Kubernetes deployment configurations for each service are located in the `kubernetes` directory. Each YAML file defines the necessary resources, including deployments, services, and any required configurations.

### Services

- **Product Catalog Service**: Defined in `product-catalog.yaml`
- **User Management Service**: Defined in `user-management.yaml`
- **Order Service**: Defined in `order.yaml`
- **Payment Service**: Defined in `payment.yaml`
- **API Gateway**: Defined in `api-gateway.yaml`
- **Redis**: Defined in `redis.yaml`

## Terraform Configuration

The `terraform` directory contains the Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) for provisioning cloud resources on AWS. This includes setting up the necessary infrastructure components such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, and any other required resources.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Set up AWS CLI**: Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured with the necessary permissions to create resources.

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - Navigate to the `infrastructure/terraform` directory.
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
   - Run `terraform apply` to provision the resources.

3. **Deploy Services**:
   - Ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
   - Navigate to the `infrastructure/kubernetes` directory.
   - Apply each service configuration using `kubectl apply -f <service-file>.yaml`.

4. **Verify Deployment**: Check the status of the deployed services using `kubectl get pods` and ensure all services are running as expected.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that all environment variables and secrets are properly configured for each service.
- Monitor the services using tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance and health checks.
- For local development, consider using Docker Compose as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

This documentation will be updated as the infrastructure evolves and new services are added.
